== Introduction

The CiscoSpark Connector facilitates connections between Anypoint Studio and Cisco Spark Application. Cisco Spark Application brings teams together instantly in rooms where we can send messages, video chat, and share files, all in one place.
Quickly, easily and securely extend the capabilities of Cisco Spark application throughout the enterprise with the Anypoint CiscoSpark connector from MuleSoft. The Anypoint CiscoSpark connector makes it simple to manage teams, rooms, send and receive files and instant workspaces for teams without having to interface with the Cisco Spark platform directly. +

=== Prerequisites

 This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,Anypoint connectors and the Anypoint Studio Interface. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more Anypoint Studio Tutorials. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of Mule flows and Mule Global Elements.
This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface, and, also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

=== Requirements

•	Windows 7 64-bit +
•	Mule Soft Software - +
          Anypoint Studio - Tooling for Mule ESB. +
          Version: 5.3.2. +
          Build Id: 201510191606. +

•	Install JDK 7 for DevKit 3.6 or 3.7. +


=== Compatibility Matrix
The Cisco Spark Connector is compatible with:

Application/Service	     Version
Mule Run-time	3.7.0 or later

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange
As we can see in the image below the Cisco Tropo Connector is available in connectors palette.
image::palette.jpg[]

=== Configuring
To use the CiscoSpark Connector in your Mule application, you must configure:
•	A global CiscoSpark element to be used by all the CiscoSpark connectors in the application (read more about global elements in Mule).
•	Parameters of each CiscoSpark Connector instance in the flow.

Follow these steps to create a global CiscoSpark configuration in a Mule application:
    
1.	 Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas, then click Create
2.	 In the Choose Global Type wizard, use the filter to locate and select,
      CiscoSpark configuration then click OK.
3.	Configure the parameters according to the instructions shown in the below image.

== Example Use Case
In this example flow, We are creating New Spark room where User can send messages, add additions users, etc.
===  Anypoint Studio Visual Editor | XML Editor

Explain how to create this case with  Anypoint Studio  visual editor and XML editor +


[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....
[tab content goes here]
Create a new project by clicking New > Mule Project >Project Name: sparkroomcreateapplication.
1. Drag an HTTP connector into sparkroomcreateapplication flow. Open the connector’s properties editor.
2. Click on the + icon shown in the image below.
image::httpProperties.jpg[]
3. The Global Element Properties window of HTTP Listener Configuration opens. Enter 8081 for Port as shown below and click on 'Ok'.
image::httpGlobalProperties.jpg[]
