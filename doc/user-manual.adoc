== Introduction

Codeship is a fast and secure hosted Continuous Delivery platform that scales with your needs.The Codeship is configured to build and deploy the application from GitHub to the staging or the production platform of your choice. +
The practice of continuous integration involves repeated automated testing and code merging with notifications to alert developers to problems in their code in real time. Codeship combines this with the practice of continuous delivery, which provides for regular code deployment once changes have passed automated tests.+
Codeship Connector Operations +

1. Get Projects +
This operation is used to list all available Projects. +
2. Get Project by ID +
This operation is used to show the details of project by project ID.  +
3. Restart Build +
This operation is used to restart the build by build ID. +

=== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,Anypoint connectors and the Anypoint Studio Interface. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more Anypoint Studio Tutorials. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of Mule flows and Mule Global Elements.
This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface, and, also includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

=== Requirements

•	Windows 7 64-bit +
•	Mule Soft Software - +
          Anypoint Studio - Tooling for Mule ESB. +
          Version: 5.3.2. +
          Build Id: 201510191606. +

•	Install JDK 7 for DevKit 3.6 or 3.7. +


=== Compatibility Matrix
The Codeship Connector is compatible with:

Application/Service	     Version
Mule Run-time	3.7.0 or later

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange
As we can see in the image below the Cisco Tropo Connector is available in connectors palette.

=== Configuring
To use the Codeship Connector in your Mule application, you must configure:
•	A global Codeship element to be used by all the Codeship connectors in the application (read more about global elements in Mule).
•	Parameters of each Codeship Connector instance in the flow.

Follow these steps to create a global Codeship configuration in a Mule application:
    
1.	 Click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas, then click Create
2.	 In the Choose Global Type wizard, use the filter to locate and select,
      Codeship configuration then click OK.
3.	Configure the parameters according to the instructions shown in the below image.

|Field	|Description

|Name	|Enter a name for the configuration so it can be referenced later 

|Authorization       	|Authorization Token for connecting and loggin into Codeship


|URL		|https://api.Codeship.com/v1

== Using This Connector

Follow these steps to configure the parameters of a Codeship Connector in the flow:   

1.	Drag the Codeship Connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor. +
2.	Configure the connector’s parameters according to the table below. +
|===
|Field	|Description
|Display Name	|Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|Connector Configuration	|Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global Codeship connector element that you created in the previous steps.
|Operation	|Select the action this component must perform:
 Get Projects,Get Project by ID ,Restart Build 
|General	|Reference or expression: Select this option to define the parameters based on expression.
Define Attributes: Select this option to define the values manually.
|===

3.	Click the blank space on the canvas to save your configurations. +

== Example Use Case
In this example flow, We are creating New Spark room where User can send messages, add additions users, etc.
===  Anypoint Studio Visual Editor | XML Editor

Explain how to create this case with  Anypoint Studio  visual editor and XML editor +


[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....
[tab content goes here]
Create a new project by clicking New > Mule Project >Project Name: codeshipcreateapplication.
1. Drag an HTTP connector into codeshipcreateapplication flow. Open the connector’s properties editor.
2. Click on the + icon shown in the image below.
image::httpProperties.jpg[]
3. The Global Element Properties window of HTTP Listener Configuration opens. Enter 8081 for Port as shown below and click on 'Ok'.
image::httpGlobalProperties.jpg[]
4. The new flow is now reachable through the path http://localhost:8081 from the local system.
5. Drag Codeship connector into codeshipcreateapplication flow.
6. Configure the Codeship connector according to the table below.

|===
|Field	|Description
|Display Name	|Codeship.
|Connector Configuration	|select the global configuration created earlier.
|Operation	|Create Rooms
 |General	|Select Define Attributes:
|			|Title|MuleTestroom
|			|Members| None
|===

7. Drag a Object to Json transformer to the flow.
8. Save it.


[tab,title="XML Editor"]
....
1. Add a Codeship:config global element to your project, then configure its attributes according to the table below (see code below for a complete sample).+
 <Codeship:config name="Codeship__Configuration" authorization="Bearer ODY5MDBiYjctNDY4NS00ODI0LThhZjktNTUxMTcyNGI3OWMyZjRiNWRhM2MtZmZk" doc:name="Codeship: Configuration"/>

|===
|Attribute|Value
|name|Codeship__Configuration
|authorization|<Auth Token>
|===
2. Add a http:listener-config global element to you project +

3. Create a Mule flow with an HTTP endpoint, configuring the endpoint according to the table below (see code below for a complete sample). +
    <http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"/>
	
|===
|Attribute|Value
|name|HTTP_Listener_Configuration
|host|0.0.0.0
|port|8081
|===

4. Add a CodeshipConnector to your muleflow after the http endpoint according to the table below
		<Codeship:create-rooms config-ref="Codeship__Configuration" doc:name="Codeship">
            <Codeship:rooms-post-request title="MuleTestRoom"/>
        </Codeship:create-rooms>
|===
|Attribute|Value
|config-ref|Codeship__Configuration
|operation|create-rooms
|title|MuleTestRoom
|===

5. Add a Object to Json transformer to your muleflow after the CodeshipConnector
 <json:object-to-json-transformer doc:name="Object to JSON"/>
....
